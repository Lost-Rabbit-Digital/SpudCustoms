Potato processing workflow:

The megaphone functions correctly to call in new potatoes.

Potato information is correctly displayed in the passport
Stamp application process works smoothly (both approval and rejection stamps)

Potato exits correctly based on the stamp applied... with some exceptions. Not sure if thats a joke or not but I have send
a video link of a rejected potato still running in. Maybe its for humor.


Game mechanics:

Score and strikes are updating correctly

The game ends appropriately after 5 strikes

Game transitions to the win scene when the score reaches a multiple of 25


User interface interactions:

Dragging and dropping of passports and bulletin = Okay.

Opening and closing animations for passports and bulletin work correctly.

Sound effects play at appropriate times (e.g., stamp sounds, customs officer phrases)


Rule system:

New rules are generated and displayed correctly... some are redundant thought.

The game correctly identifies valid and invalid potatoes based on the current rules


Queue management:

New potatoes are spawning correctly in the queue

Queue moves properly when potatoes are processed


Visual elements:

Potato textures and animations are displaying correctly

No visual glitches or misalignments in the UI


Performance:

No lag or frame rate issues, especially when multiple animations are playing


Edge cases:

Try rapidly clicking buttons or dragging multiple objects simultaneously ===== Nothing wrong happens.

Test what happens if you try to process a potato without applying a stamp === It doesnt process without a stamp.
