=== STEAM PATCH NOTES (BBCode) ===

[h1]Spud Customs v1.2.0 - The "One Year Later" Update[/h1]

[i]A personal note from the developer:[/i]

When I first launched Spud Customs, my newborn son had just been admitted to the NICU. I was prepping the game for release while we were checking into the hospital. I rushed the launch because I didn't know what our family was facing.

Now, over a year later, my son is still in the NICU - but he is so much stronger. And in the quiet hours between visits, I've been hard at work bringing Spud Customs closer to the vision I had before life took an unexpected turn.

To everyone who has supported us - thank you. Over 2,000 people have played Spud Customs and joined us on this journey since launch, and every single one of you means the world to me. Your feedback, your patience, and your interest in our little story of potato redemption has kept me going.

This update is for you.
