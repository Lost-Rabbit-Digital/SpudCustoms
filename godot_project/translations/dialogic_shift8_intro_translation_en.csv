Text/11b/text,[tornado radius=3 freq=2][color=RED]Full cooperation[/color][/tornado] with Security is mandatory. My reports on each of you have been provided to the Chief.
Text/11c/text,Russet's gaze lingers on you uncomfortably before moving on.
Text/11d/text,This is the [color=DARK_ORANGE]IdentityScan 5000[/color]. It analyzes biometrics to detect infiltrators and sympathizers.
Text/11e/text,Anyone triggering the scanner will face [color=CRIMSON]enhanced interrogation[/color]. Use it without exception.
Text/11f/text,"Have you seen Sasha? She didn't report for roll call. Last night, [color=CRIMSON]security forces entered her quarters[/color]."
Text/120/text,They're saying she was part of the [pulse freq=2][color=CHARTREUSE]resistance[/color][/pulse].
Choice/121/text,"""We shouldn't be talking about this. It's dangerous."""
Choice/122/text,"""I'm worried about her too. This isn't right."""
Text/123/text,You're right. But watch yourself. They're looking for connections to her.
Text/124/text,So you were close? Be careful. They might be watching you too.
Text/125/text,"The officer slips you a note: ""[color=YELLOW]Clean your station of anything suspicious.[/color]"""

Choice/12a/text,"""I was gathering evidence on her suspicious activities to report later."""
Text/12b/text,"Multiple witnesses say otherwise. Without concrete evidence though, I can't detain you. [color=YELLOW]Yet.[/color]"
Text/12c/text,"You'll be under [color=CRIMSON]close observation[/color]. One misstep, and you'll [color=DARK_VIOLET]join Sasha[/color]."
Text/12d/text,How convenient. And yet you filed no reports until now.
Text/12e/text,"You'll provide a complete statement. If your information proves valuable, perhaps we'll overlook your delayed reporting."
Text/12f/text,I'll be [color=CRIMSON]monitoring your work[/color] today. Every traveler must be identity-scanned. [color=RED]No exceptions[/color].
Text/130/text,"Sasha has been taken. The resistance plan is [color=CRIMSON]compromised[/color]. With security on high alert, their chances seem hopeless."
