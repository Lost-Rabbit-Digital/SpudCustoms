Text/240/text,"As the evening shift winds down, most officers have left. Only you and a handful of guards remain."
Text/241/text,A burly guard approaches your station. Name's Viktor. I'm on night watch.
Text/242/text,"His eyes are tired, haunted. You're the new one, right? The one Russet keeps watching?"
Choice/243/text,Just trying to do my job. Why does Russet watch me?
Choice/244/text,Is there something I should know?
Text/245/text,He shrugs heavily. Russet watches everyone who asks questions. My [color=STEEL_BLUE]wife asked questions[/color] once.
Text/246/text,She's not around to ask anymore.
Text/247/text,"He glances around, then lowers his voice. Just... be careful who you trust."
Text/248/text,And who you [color=CRIMSON]condemn[/color]. Some of us remember every face we sent to processing.
Text/249/text,"A nervous potato approaches. Papers seem in order, but you notice the [color=CHARTREUSE]subtle leaf pin[/color] on their collar."
Text/24a/text,"They slide their documents across. A tiny note is tucked inside: ""[color=CHARTREUSE]Sasha sent me. Package for the network. Please.[/color]"""
Text/24b/text,The new [color=DARK_ORANGE]RealityScan[/color] blinks ready at your station. One scan and it will detect forged elements in their papers.
Choice/24c/text,Pretend the scanner malfunctioned and wave them through
Choice/24d/text,Use the scanner as required - you can't risk exposure
Choice/24e/text,"Signal Viktor to look the other way, then let them pass"
Text/24f/text,"You tap the scanner, frown, tap it again. ""Blasted thing's acting up. Go on through."""
Text/250/text,"Relief floods their face. They mouth ""[color=CHARTREUSE]Thank you[/color]"" and hurry past."
Text/251/text,"You catch his eye and nod toward the operative. He looks at them, then at you."
Text/252/text,"He turns his back deliberately, studying the wall. ""[color=STEEL_BLUE]Scanner's been glitchy all day.[/color]"""
Text/253/text,"The operative slips through. Viktor says nothing, but you've shared a secret now."
Text/254/text,"You run the scan. The machine [color=RED]blares[/color]. ""Forged documentation detected."""
Text/255/text,"Horror dawns on their face. ""[color=CRIMSON]You don't understand what you've done...[/color]"""
Text/256/text,"He and other guards close in. The operative is dragged away, still staring at you."
Text/257/text,Sasha catches you in the shadows. That operative was carrying [color=CHARTREUSE]copies of the manifests[/color] to our contacts outside.
Text/258/text,"Because of you, the truth will spread beyond Spud's borders. [color=CHARTREUSE]You've made a real difference.[/color]"
Text/259/text,Sasha's eyes widen. Viktor helped? I had a feeling about him. His wife was...
Text/25a/text,She trails off. We have more allies than I thought.
Text/25b/text,"Sasha finds you, her expression cold. That operative had a family. Three sprouts at home."
Text/25c/text,I understand fear. But [color=CRIMSON]fear has consequences[/color]. They'll be processed by morning.
Text/25d/text,I hope your clean record is worth it.
Text/25e/text,Murphy slips into your quarters. Heard there was some excitement at your station tonight.
Text/25f/text,[color=CHARTREUSE]Good. We're in this together now.[/color] No turning back.
Text/260/text,Murphy's face falls. I... I thought you were with us. What happened?
Text/261/text,Tomorrow's shift will be different. The stakes have never been higher.
Text/262/text,"But for the first time, you feel like you're on the [color=CHARTREUSE]right side[/color]. Whatever that costs."
Text/263/text,The operative's face haunts you. Their family will never know why they didn't come home.
Text/264/text,[color=STEEL_BLUE]Because of you.[/color]
