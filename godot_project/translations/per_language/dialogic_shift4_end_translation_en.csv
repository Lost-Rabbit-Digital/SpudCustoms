Text/215/text,"Murphy catches you in the corridor, eyes red-rimmed. Got a minute?"
Text/216/text,Murphy pulls you into an empty storage room and closes the door.
Text/217/text,That joke I made in the cafeteria... about my cousin being in the [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] batch...
Text/218/text,Murphy's voice cracks. I don't think it was a joke anymore.
Text/219/text,You said it wasn't funny. You were right. [color=STEEL_BLUE]Nothing about this is funny.[/color]
Text/21a/text,"I saw you leave. Smart. I wish I could stop eating that stuff, but they [color=YELLOW]watch[/color]. They always watch."
Text/21b/text,"I found something in my cousin's belongings. His rejection form. Standard stuff, but..."
Text/21c/text,"Murphy pulls out a crumpled form. Look at the processing code. ""[color=CRIMSON]RR-UTIL-7[/color]."""
Text/21d/text,I looked it up in the archives. RR stands for [pulse freq=2][color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color][/pulse]. UTIL means... [color=CRIMSON]utilization[/color].
Text/21d_breakdown1/text,[wave amp=20 freq=3]Murphy's hands start shaking.[/wave] My cousin... Tommy... he was just twenty-three.
Text/21d_breakdown2/text,He came here for a [color=CHARTREUSE]better life[/color]. Failed one inspection. One. [color=STEEL_BLUE]Just bad timing.[/color]
Text/21d_breakdown3/text,"Murphy slides down the wall, face in his hands. And I... I [tornado radius=3 freq=2][color=CRIMSON]ATE[/color][/tornado] that stuff. Every day."
Text/21d_breakdown4/text,"Murphy looks up at you, tears streaming. [pulse freq=2][color=CRIMSON]What if I ate HIM?[/color][/pulse]"
Choice/21e/text,Murphy... I'm so sorry. I'm with you. We'll find the truth together.
Choice/21f/text,"Murphy, this is dangerous. We should stay out of it."
Choice/220/text,Maybe it's a coincidence. Let's not jump to conclusions.
Text/221_comfort1/text,"You kneel beside Murphy, putting a hand on his shoulder."
Text/221/text,Murphy grabs your arm like a lifeline. [color=CHARTREUSE]Thank you.[/color] I thought I was going crazy.
Text/221_tommy/text,[color=STEEL_BLUE]His voice steadies slightly.[/color] For Tommy. We do this for Tommy. And everyone else they've taken.
Text/222/text,There's others who suspect too. Sasha's been gathering people. I think she trusts you.
Text/223/text,"Murphy wipes his eyes, trying to compose himself. Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right. Forget I said anything."
Text/224/text,But if you change your mind... I'll be here. [color=STEEL_BLUE]Alone with my questions. And my nightmares.[/color]
Text/225/text,Coincidence. Murphy laughs bitterly through his tears. Sure. And Tommy just [color=CRIMSON]vanished[/color] into thin air.
Text/226/text,Keep telling yourself that. See how long it helps you sleep. [color=STEEL_BLUE]It doesn't help me.[/color]
Text/227/text,Sasha appears at your booth as the last shift ends. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Text/228/text,Let me guess - Murphy told you about his cousin?
Text/229/text,Sasha nods approvingly. Good. We need people who ask questions.
Text/22a/text,Sasha studies your face carefully. You're scared. That's smart. But fear won't save anyone.
Text/22b/text,"I've been watching you since your first day. The way you [color=YELLOW]hesitated[/color] when Russet talked about ""processing."""
Text/22c/text,You asked what happens to rejected potatoes. That took guts. [color=CHARTREUSE]Most just salute and stamp.[/color]
Text/22d/text,Sasha leans closer. There's a pattern. Every potato we reject? Gone within 48 hours. No deportation records. No transfers.
Text/22e/text,But [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] production? [tornado radius=3 freq=2][color=CRIMSON]It goes up.[/color][/tornado] Every. Single. Time.
Choice/22f/text,I believe you. How can I help?
Choice/230/text,I need to see proof before I risk everything.
Text/231/text,"Sasha's eyes light up. I knew I picked right. Tomorrow night, after shift. I'll show you what I've found."
Text/232/text,Until then, act normal. [color=YELLOW]Russet is watching everyone.[/color]
Text/233/text,Fair enough. Proof is coming. Just... keep your eyes open during tomorrow's shift.
Text/234/text,Watch where the [color=CRIMSON]rejected potatoes[/color] go. Follow the trucks if you can.
Text/235/text,You pull out the photo the desperate potato gave you. Her wife. [color=STEEL_BLUE]Where is she now?[/color]
Text/236/text,"If what Sasha and Murphy are saying is true... she's already been..."
Text/237/text,You can't finish the thought. But you [color=CHARTREUSE]won't forget her face[/color].
Text/238/text,"Tomorrow, everything changes. Either you find answers, or you bury the questions forever."
Text/239/text,One thing is certain: there's [color=YELLOW]no going back to blissful ignorance[/color].
