Text/e3/text,Sasha nods solemnly. It is dangerous. I won't lie to you about that.
Text/e4/text,We could all end up [color=DARK_VIOLET]processed into Root Reserve[/color] ourselves if we fail.

Text/e7/text,Petitions. Quiet diplomacy. Anonymous tips. Nothing has worked.
Text/e8/text,Sometimes you have to risk everything to change anything.
Text/e9/text,A heated debate breaks out among the resistance members.
Text/ea/text,Some argue for a more aggressive approach â€“ destroying the processing plants entirely.
Text/eb/text,Others insist that violent action will only turn public opinion against them.
Text/ec/text,ENOUGH! The leader silences the room with a commanding voice.

Text/f8/text,"The leader nods slowly, clearly disappointed but understanding."
Text/f9/text,Sometimes the most we can ask is for people not to stand in our way.
Text/fa/text,Our agents will proceed as planned. Just... don't raise the alarm.
Text/fb/text,The leader's expression hardens. [color=YELLOW]Time is a luxury we don't have.[/color]
Text/fc/text,But forcing anyone to join our cause makes us no better than them.
Text/fd/text,We'll proceed without counting on your help. Search your conscience.
Text/fe/text,"As the meeting breaks up, Sasha walks with you back toward the checkpoint."
