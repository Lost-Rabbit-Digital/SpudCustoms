## Notes for Generation

1. All items should feel like they belong in the same world - consistent lighting (upper left), consistent wear/aging
2. The potato world is dystopian 1980s Soviet - think weathered, bureaucratic, slightly grimy
3. Items should be clearly identifiable at 128x128 resolution
4. Evidence items should feel "dangerous" - worn, hidden, incriminating
5. Safe items should feel "official" - clean, bureaucratic, proper
6. Ambiguous items should feel "personal" - sentimental, could go either way
