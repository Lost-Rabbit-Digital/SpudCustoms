## Notes

- All images should maintain consistent art style with existing narrative images
- Player character should be recognizable across all frames (customs officer potato with cap/uniform)
- Each 3-frame sequence tells a mini-story: Setup → Action → Climax
- Dramatic lighting is key for tension
- Frame 3 should feel like a "payoff" moment
