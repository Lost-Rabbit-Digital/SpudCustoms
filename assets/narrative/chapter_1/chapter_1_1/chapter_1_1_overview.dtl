supervisor_russet: Listen carefully, because I won't repeat myself. The future of Spud rests on your shoulders now. No pressure, but mess up and we'll all be in hot water.

supervisor_russet: Here's your first case. Check those stamps carefully! One wrong move could let in a bad spud.
supervisor_russet: It's not just about papers! Look for signs of disease, tampering, or suspicious behavior. And if a potato's acting flaky, you think of Spud's safety.
supervisor_russet: And always pressure them with the right questions. A skilled officer can crack a liar from a mile away!
