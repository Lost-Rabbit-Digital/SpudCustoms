# Chapter 3
[background arg="res://assets/narrative/chapter_3/border_chaos.jpg" fade="1.0"]
# Image suggestion: Mass exodus of terrified potatoes fleeing from giant potato mashers and graters
The Spud border is in utter chaos.
Panicked potatoes are fleeing en masse, their eyes wide with terror.
News of Root Reserve has spread, and nothing will ever be the same.
The air is thick with the scent of fear... and oddly, mashed potatoes.

supervisor_russet: Thank spud you're here! It's all falling apart faster than an overcooked potato! We're really in the soup now... or should I say, the pur√©e?
supervisor_russet: The truth about Root Reserve... it's out. Turns out people don't like the idea of being turned into tomorrow's lunch. Who knew cannibalism could be so unpopular? Talk about biting the hand that feeds you!
supervisor_russet: We need to contain this situation, now! Before we all end up in the great potato masher in the sky! Or worse, in the value meal section!

supervisor_russet: Listen carefully, you half-baked rookie. We're in crisis mode. It's time to separate the mashed from the au gratin!
supervisor_russet: You'll need to make rapid decisions. Every choice counts. It's fry or be fried out there!
supervisor_russet: Maintain order, or join the chaos. It's up to you. But remember, in Spud, you're either serving the nation or serving as the main course! And trust me, you don't want to know what the daily special is today.

supervisor_russet: We have "special" potatoes coming through. Use the UV light to verify their stamps. And don't ask why they're glowing... that's a feature, not a bug!
supervisor_russet: Follow this script for questioning. Don't deviate. And for the love of all that's starchy, don't ask where they're going. Ignorance is bliss, and in this case, it might just keep you out of the fryer. Remember, curiosity mashed the spud!

prime_minister_idaho: So, you've discovered our little secret. Yes, Root Reserve is made from distilled potatoes. Congratulations, you've unpeeled the truth!
prime_minister_idaho: But don't you see? It was necessary! Our society was on the brink of collapse. We were one bad harvest away from total annihilation!
prime_minister_idaho: Root Reserve saved us. The cost was high, but the alternative was extinction. It's a dog-eat-dog world out there... or in our case, a potato-eat-potato world.
prime_minister_idaho: The choice is yours. Arrest me, negotiate, or join me. What'll it be? Remember, in Spud, you're either part of the solution or part of the dissolution!

- "This is monstrous! You'll face justice for this! Prepare to be served... a summons!"
- "I... I understand. But there must be another way. Can't we find a solution that doesn't involve cannibalism? Maybe a nice potato salad instead?"
- "You did what you had to do. How can I help maintain stability? After all, sacrifices must be made for the greater gouda... I mean, good!"
