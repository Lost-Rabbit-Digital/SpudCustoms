supervisor_russet: Don't forget to grab your ration of [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color]. "[color=MEDIUM_VIOLET_RED]It's the flavor of Spud's future![/color]"

A small note slips out: "[color=GOLD]Not all is as it seems. The roots of our nation have grown rotten. Follow the trail, but take care not to be silenced.[/color] - [color=CHARTREUSE]A friend[/color]"

player_character: That note... and the way Russet dodged my question about [color=CRIMSON]rejected potatoes[/color]... Something feels [color=STEEL_BLUE]off[/color].
player_character: I should stay [color=YELLOW]alert[/color]. There's more going on here than stamping passports.

sweet_potato_sasha: Good, you made it. The resistance is [color=CHARTREUSE]growing stronger[/color]. Thanks to those manifests, people are seeing the truth.

sweet_potato_sasha: I managed to get this dossier from our sources - production schedules, '[color=CRIMSON]ingredient[/color]' lists, names of the [color=DARK_SLATE_BLUE]disappeared[/color].

sweet_potato_sasha: This isn't just a food supplement program. They're [color=CRIMSON]processing potatoes[/color]...and not in a good way.

player_character: Internal memos from Prime Minister Idaho himself, authorizing the "[color=DARK_ORANGE]utilization of rejected assets.[/color]"

announcer: [color=YELLOW]EMERGENCY BROADCAST[/color]: Recent circulation of [color=CRIMSON]forged documents[/color] has caused unnecessary panic.

announcer: A reward of [color=GOLD]10,000 Spud Credits[/color] is offered for information leading to the capture of these saboteurs.

announcer: Consuming or distributing this propaganda is now classified as [color=RED]high treason[/color].

supervisor_russet: Those demonstrating [color=CRIMSON]anti-government sentiments[/color] are to be flagged immediately.

supervisor_russet: The [color=CRIMSON]traitor in our midst[/color] will be found. And when they are... [draws finger across throat]

traveler_1: A nervous potato approaches, [color=GOLD]yellow leaf badge[/color] partially visible. A tiny note is tucked between papers: "[color=CHARTREUSE]Safe house compromised. New location: Warehouse 7, Sector 4.[/color]"

sweet_potato_sasha: "Your decision was noticed. Be ready. [color=CHARTREUSE]Something big is coming[/color]. The resistance is planning a direct action."

sweet_potato_sasha: "When it happens, you'll need to [color=YELLOW]choose a side[/color]. There won't be any middle ground left."

player_character: With each potato you process, you're either [color=CHARTREUSE]aiding a revolution[/color] or [color=CRIMSON]enabling a horrific system[/color].

player_character: You hunker down as the battle rages. I'm sorry, Sasha. I'm [color=STEEL_BLUE]not as brave as you[/color].

supervisor_russet: "The [color=CRIMSON]terrorist attack[/color] has been repelled! The ringleaders are being [color=DARK_VIOLET]processed[/color] as we speak."

security_chief: Chief Yukon drags in resistance members in chains, Sasha among them. "These [color=CRIMSON]traitors[/color] will face [color=DARK_VIOLET]final processing[/color]."

security_chief: Sasha catches your eye. Despite her bruises, her gaze holds [color=CHARTREUSE]no judgment, only sadness[/color].

player_character: You've survived by keeping your head down, but [color=GOLD]at what cost?[/color] As [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] production wafts from the plant, your stomach turns.

player_character: You [color=CHARTREUSE]abandon your post[/color] and race toward the fighting. The time for caution is over.

resistance_fighter: "[color=GOLD]Prove you're with us![/color] How do you know Sasha?"

player_character: "[color=CHARTREUSE]The roots grow deep![/color] I'm from the checkpoint, Sasha recruited me!"

player_character: The doors blast open, revealing the [color=CRIMSON]horrific truth[/color] - grinding machines, conveyors carrying potatoes to their doom.

player_character: At the end of one belt - Sasha and others [color=CRIMSON]bound helplessly[/color]. Supervisor Russet stands at the controls.

supervisor_russet: "[color=RED]YOU![/color] I should have known you were one of them! Back away or I start the processor!"

sweet_potato_sasha: As resistance fighters overpower Russet, Sasha redirects the facility cameras. "[color=YELLOW]People of Spud! This is Root Reserve! They've been feeding us to each other![/color]"

sweet_potato_sasha: "You came back for me. [color=CHARTREUSE]We did it. The truth is out there now.[/color] We have a future to build!"

narrator: The border resembles a [color=CRIMSON]war zone[/color]. Barricades, armored vehicles, and elite guards stand ready. Today is when the resistance planned to strike.

announcer: [color=YELLOW]EMERGENCY BROADCAST[/color]: All of Spud is under [color=RED]martial law[/color]. "The Resistance" has launched attacks against government facilities.

announcer: Anyone aiding these [color=CRIMSON]extremists[/color] faces [color=DARK_VIOLET]immediate processing[/color]. The Ministry confirms: [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] remains safe for all [color=DARK_ORANGE]loyal potatoes[/color].

security_chief: [color=YELLOW]Rioting has broken out[/color] in multiple sectors. Resistance cells have attacked three [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] facilities.

supervisor_russet: We've captured several resistance operatives, including Officer Sasha.

sweet_potato_sasha: The [color=CRIMSON]real traitors[/color] are those who [color=DARK_VIOLET]feed our people to each other[/color]. You can't stop the truth!

sweet_potato_sasha: She's dragged away, still shouting: [color=CHARTREUSE]The people will know what's in their food![/color]

supervisor_russet: The [color=CRIMSON]traitor[/color] will be [color=DARK_VIOLET]processed immediately[/color]. A special batch of [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color], made from the terrorists themselves.

security_officer: All border crossings are [color=RED]suspended[/color] except for essential personnel with [color=GOLD]Level Alpha clearance[/color].

security_officer: This scanner [color=YELLOW]cannot be fooled[/color]. Sound the alarm immediately for anyone without proper clearance.

resistance_operative: A tiny blue card falls from the folder. "[color=CHARTREUSE]The roots grow deep.[/color]" It's the resistance password.

resistance_operative: Relief shows in their eyes. "[color=CHARTREUSE]For Sasha. For Spud.[/color]" They disappear toward the central database.

resistance_operative: Horror dawns on their face. "[color=CRIMSON]You traitor! We trusted you![/color]" They're quickly surrounded by guards.

narrator: Suddenly, the facility [color=YELLOW]shakes with explosions[/color]. The resistance attack has begun, regardless of your choice.

player_character: Do I stay at my post and hope this blows over, or [color=CHARTREUSE]take a stand[/color] and risk everything to expose the truth?

security_chief: Intelligence indicates a [color=YELLOW]terrorist attack is imminent[/color]. The "resistance" plans to infiltrate tomorrow.

security_chief: All officers will submit to [color=DARK_ORANGE]loyalty screening[/color]. Suspicious behavior means detention and [color=DARK_VIOLET]processing[/color].

supervisor_russet: [color=RED]Full cooperation[/color] with Security is mandatory. My reports on each of you have been provided to the Chief.

security_chief: This is the [color=DARK_ORANGE]IdentityScan 5000[/color]. It analyzes biometrics to detect infiltrators and sympathizers.

security_chief: Anyone flagged faces [color=CRIMSON]enhanced interrogation[/color]. Use it without exception.

fellow_officer: Have you seen Sasha? She didn't report for roll call. Last night, [color=CRIMSON]security forces entered her quarters[/color].

fellow_officer: They're saying she was part of the [color=CHARTREUSE]resistance[/color].

fellow_officer: The officer slips you a note: "[color=YELLOW]Clean your station of anything suspicious.[/color]"

security_chief: You were seen frequently with Officer Sasha, now under investigation for [color=CRIMSON]treason[/color].

security_chief: Multiple witnesses say otherwise. Without concrete evidence though, I can't detain you. [color=YELLOW]Yet.[/color]

security_chief: You'll be under [color=CRIMSON]close observation[/color]. One misstep, and you'll [color=DARK_VIOLET]join Sasha[/color].

security_officer: I'll be [color=CRIMSON]monitoring your work[/color] today. Every traveler must be identity-scanned. [color=RED]No exceptions[/color].

player_character: Sasha has been taken. The resistance plan is [color=CRIMSON]compromised[/color]. With security on high alert, their chances seem hopeless.

supervisor_russet: [color=RED]ATTENTION! LEVEL RED security situation![/color] Classified documents were stolen last night.

supervisor_russet: We have a [color=CRIMSON]traitor in our midst[/color]. Anyone withholding information will be treated as complicit.

security_officer: All officers, line up for [color=DARK_ORANGE]security scanning[/color]. Those with elevated stress responses will be flagged.

fellow_officer: Have you seen what's happening outside? Pamphlets everywhere showing [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] is made from... [color=CRIMSON]from us[/color].

fellow_officer: My cousin was rejected last month. Does that mean...? I [color=CHARTREUSE]can't do this anymore[/color].

security_chief: Your stress levels indicate [color=YELLOW]deception[/color]. However... inconclusive. You may go for now.

sweet_potato_sasha: It's working. The manifests have caused an uproar, but [color=DARK_ORANGE]Russet suspects us[/color].

sweet_potato_sasha: Watch for allies from our organization during today's shift. [color=CHARTREUSE]You'll recognize them[/color].

sweet_potato_sasha: If you can get them through safely, use the [color=CHARTREUSE]special mark we discussed[/color].

sweet_potato_sasha: I knew I could count on you. When this is over, [color=CHARTREUSE]Spud will know who the real heroes were[/color].

sweet_potato_sasha: We're way past that point. Laying low won't save us. [color=CHARTREUSE]Only bringing down the system will[/color].

supervisor_russet: Each station now has the new [color=DARK_ORANGE]VeracityScan system[/color]. It detects unauthorized markings and forgeries.

supervisor_russet: All documents must be scanned before approval. The [color=CRIMSON]traitors will be rooted out[/color]. I guarantee it.

player_character: Helping resistance members just got much more dangerous, but [color=CHARTREUSE]the truth must spread[/color].
```

## shift7_end.dtl

resistance_leader: Our sources confirm that [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] processing plants are increasing production.

resistance_leader: Which means [color=CRIMSON]more of our brothers and sisters disappeared, processed, consumed[/color].

resistance_leader: The leader pounds a fist on the table. [color=CHARTREUSE]This ends now.[/color] We have a plan to strike at the heart of their operation.

sweet_potato_sasha: In three days, we launch our [color=CHARTREUSE]primary offensive[/color].

sweet_potato_sasha: Our goal: obtain [color=CHARTREUSE]irrefutable evidence[/color] of what happens inside, broadcast it to all of Spud.

sweet_potato_sasha: We need someone on the inside at Spud Customs to ensure our operatives can cross the border for the mission.

sweet_potato_sasha: Sasha's face lights up with hope. Thank you. [color=CHARTREUSE]Your courage will save countless lives.[/color]

sweet_potato_sasha: She squeezes your hand. When this is all over, [color=CHARTREUSE]you'll be remembered as a hero of the revolution.[/color]

sweet_potato_sasha: We could all end up [color=DARK_VIOLET]processed into Root Reserve[/color] ourselves if we fail.

resistance_leader: The leader turns to address you directly. But we need to know [color=YELLOW]where you stand[/color].

resistance_leader: In three days, our agents will approach your checkpoint. They'll carry [color=CHARTREUSE]blue identification cards[/color].

resistance_leader: The leader clasps your shoulder firmly. [color=CHARTREUSE]Your courage honors us all.[/color]

resistance_leader: On the third day, when the sun is highest, our agents will come.

resistance_leader: The password is "[color=CHARTREUSE]The roots grow deep.[/color]" Remember it.

resistance_leader: The leader's expression hardens. [color=YELLOW]Time is a luxury we don't have.[/color]

player_character: In just three days, everything could change. [color=YELLOW]For better or worse.[/color]

sweet_potato_sasha: "[color=CHARTREUSE]This device will disable the lock[/color] on Russet's office. I'll trigger alarms in the east wing as a distraction. You'll have five minutes."

sweet_potato_sasha: "The manifests should be in his filing cabinet. [color=CRIMSON]Red folder labeled 'RR Transport'[/color]. Don't leave evidence of your search."

player_character: You find the thick [color=CRIMSON]red folder labeled "RR Transport"[/color] in the filing cabinet.

player_character: Inside are manifests matching rejected potato counts, and a directive from Prime Minister Idaho authorizing "[color=DARK_VIOLET]full utilization of border rejects for RR production.[/color]"

Footsteps approach the office door. "[color=YELLOW]Strange, I could've sworn I locked this.[/color]"

player_character: You dive under Russet's desk as he enters, your heart pounding. He sits, his feet inches from your face.

player_character: "Russet here. What? [color=CHARTREUSE]Another alarm?[/color] I'm on my way." He leaves, and you escape.

player_character: You wrench open the window and jump. Thankfully it's only one story. A guard shouts: "[color=RED]Hey! Stop![/color]"

sweet_potato_sasha: "[color=CHARTREUSE]This proves everything.[/color] The resistance will make copies. Spread the truth everywhere. They can't silence us all."

player_character: You've crossed a line. [color=YELLOW]There's no going back.[/color] When the truth spreads, Spud will be transformed.

supervisor_russet: Last night, [color=CRIMSON]prohibited materials[/color] were discovered. Pamphlets containing lies about [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color].

supervisor_russet: We're implementing [color=YELLOW]threat level ORANGE protocols[/color]. All officers subject to loyalty screenings. All travelers face maximum scrutiny.

sweet_potato_sasha: It's working. The pamphlets are spreading. People are asking questions about [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color].

sweet_potato_sasha: I have sources telling me there's a shipment log in Russet's office - transport manifests that could [color=CHARTREUSE]prove everything[/color].

sweet_potato_sasha: I need you to help me get it. Tonight, after final shift. Can I count on you?

sweet_potato_sasha: Thank goodness. I knew you had [color=CHARTREUSE]stronger roots than the others[/color]. We'll meet at midnight.

sweet_potato_sasha: Sometimes we have to [color=CHARTREUSE]risk getting mashed to do what's right[/color]. Think about it.

security_officer: [color=DARK_ORANGE]Loyalty check[/color]. Please state your name and officer ID. Then tell me why you serve Spud.

security_officer: The officer's eyebrows raise. Fair treatment? Scanner flashes [color=YELLOW]amber[/color]. Remember, our primary concern is security, not fairness.

supervisor_russet: Today's quota has been increased. Anyone with suspicious materials is to be flagged for [color=DARK_VIOLET]special processing[/color].

supervisor_russet: I'll be [color=DARK_ORANGE]watching your decisions[/color] very carefully today.

player_character: Tonight could change everything. But first, [color=YELLOW]survive the day without raising suspicion[/color].
```

## shift4_intro.dtl
```
supervisor_russet: New security protocols today. We've received intelligence about [color=YELLOW]suspicious activities[/color].

supervisor_russet: Watch for [color=YELLOW]nervous behavior, unusual mannerisms, or reluctance to make eye contact[/color].

supervisor_russet: All suspicious items must be confiscated and logged. For Spud's security, of course.

security_officer: We're especially concerned about [color=CRIMSON]seditious materials[/color] - anti-government literature, photography equipment...

security_officer: Their voice drops ominously. [color=DARK_VIOLET]We have special procedures for those individuals.[/color]

narrator: [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] trucks unload crates marked "Premium Reserve" into the cafeteria. The smell is enticing, but your stomach turns.

fellow_officer: Have you tried the new Premium Reserve? My cousin disappeared last month. Failed inspection.

fellow_officer: Maybe he's part of this batch, huh? [color=STEEL_BLUE]Dark humor, you know?[/color]

fellow_officer: You're right. Sometimes joking is easier than thinking about [color=CRIMSON]what might actually be happening[/color].

sweet_potato_sasha: Convenient timing for new security protocols, isn't it? [color=YELLOW]They're trying to stop information about Root Reserve.[/color]

sweet_potato_sasha: I have something that might help us. Some potatoes with [color=CHARTREUSE]vital information deserve to get through[/color].

player_character: You consider your options carefully. Today's choices could help [color=CHARTREUSE]spread truth[/color]... or [color=CRIMSON]silence it forever[/color].
```

## shift3_intro.dtl
```
supervisor_russet: New orders from the top. We're [color=DARK_ORANGE]doubling rejections[/color]. Any potato deemed unsafe is detained immediately.

supervisor_russet: I have a special assignment. We've got intel on [color=CRIMSON]troublemakers[/color]. Be vigilant with your inspections.

supervisor_russet: The kind that [color=CRIMSON]threaten our way of life[/color]. Don't ask too many questions if you know what's good for you.

npc_3: [color=STEEL_BLUE]Please, I beg you![/color] My wife was supposed to be right behind me, but she never made it through customs.

npc_3: No one will tell me what happened to her. Please, [color=CHARTREUSE]help me find her![/color]

npc_3: Just like all the others... [color=STEEL_BLUE]May your conscience weigh heavy as mine does.[/color]

supervisor_russet: I saw that exchange. [color=DARK_ORANGE]Sympathizing with rejects only leads to trouble.[/color] Stay focused on your duty.
```

## shift3_end.dtl
```
sweet_potato_sasha: Can we talk? Somewhere private? [color=YELLOW]Too many eyes and ears here.[/color]

supervisor_russet: Getting cozy with coworkers? Remember, fraternization can lead to... [color=DARK_ORANGE]compromised judgment[/color].

sweet_potato_sasha: I've been gathering information about rejected potatoes. [color=CRIMSON]They don't go to deportation centers.[/color]

sweet_potato_sasha: [color=CRIMSON]They go to Root Reserve processing facilities.[/color] Every single one.

sweet_potato_sasha: These documents show potatoes being unloaded at a facility marked with the [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] logo.

sweet_potato_sasha: I think I know what's happening. [color=CRIMSON]They're becoming Root Reserve.[/color]

sweet_potato_sasha: [color=CRIMSON]Cannibalism with extra steps.[/color] That's what [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] is. And we've been helping select their ingredients.

sweet_potato_sasha: We need to go. They do security sweeps at this hour. Think about what I've shown you.

sweet_potato_sasha: Sasha stuffs the folder into your hands. [color=YELLOW]Keep this safe. And trust no one.[/color]

player_character: You hide the folder inside your jacket. [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color]. The rejections. The missing potatoes. It all connects in a [color=CRIMSON]horrifying way[/color].
```

## shift2_intro.dtl
```
sweet_potato_sasha: Sasha leans in close: "[color=YELLOW]And keep your eyes peeled. Not everything is as it seems in Spud.[/color]"

supervisor_russet: Your next applicant is waiting. Check those stamps carefully! Any [color=YELLOW]suspicious behavior[/color] is to be reported.

supervisor_russet: Remember, a [color=DARK_ORANGE]dutiful officer[/color] has nothing to fear. Those who abandon their duty abandon their roots.

announcer: "...record production numbers for [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color]. The miracle food continues to nourish our nation..."

announcer: "In other news, reports of [color=CRIMSON]missing potatoes[/color] continue. Authorities assure no connection..."

narrator: Welcome to the nation of Spud. A land of [color=MEDIUM_VIOLET_RED]prosperity for all potatoes[/color].

narrator: You've been selected for a [color=DARK_ORANGE]crucial role[/color] in protecting our borders.

narrator: Your duty: to process incoming potatoes. Your family's well-being [color=YELLOW]depends on your performance[/color].

narrator: BEHOLD! The [color=MEDIUM_VIOLET_RED]mighty wall[/color] that safeguards our nation. This is where you'll serve, ensuring only the worthy enter.

supervisor_russet: Ah, the new sprout. Listen carefully, your role is [color=DARK_ORANGE]vital to Spud's security[/color].

supervisor_russet: I appoint you as a Customs Officer of [color=MEDIUM_VIOLET_RED]glorious Spud[/color]. Any questions?

supervisor_russet: Excellent! That's the kind of enthusiasm we need. You might earn a [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] commendation.

supervisor_russet: They're... [color=DARK_VIOLET]processed[/color]. According to protocol. [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] handles all the details.

supervisor_russet: Focus on your duties. [color=DARK_ORANGE]Nothing more.[/color]

supervisor_russet: Your first shift begins now. Check papers carefully, deny those who don't meet our standards.

supervisor_russet: Meet your quota, avoid strikes. [color=MEDIUM_VIOLET_RED]Glory to Spud![/color]

narrator: The Spud border is in [color=CRIMSON]chaos[/color]. Panicked potatoes flood checkpoints, desperate to escape after the leaked documents.

player_character: You slip through with Sasha. "[color=CHARTREUSE]We have to keep pushing![/color] The people know the truth now."

sweet_potato_sasha: "They can't silence the truth any longer. If we can infiltrate the [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] facility and broadcast evidence, it'll [color=CHARTREUSE]ignite the revolution[/color]."

resistance_member_2: "That place is a fortress. And now we've got a [color=YELLOW]former customs agent[/color] in our midst." Their eyes narrow suspiciously.

narrator: After a tense infiltration, your team stands at the heart of [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color], the [color=CRIMSON]horrific machinery of oppression[/color] laid bare.

narrator: [color=RED]Alarms blare[/color] as guards scramble to respond to your intrusion. You race through corridors, dodging security systems.

prime_minister_idaho: A screen flickers on. "Well well, the [color=CRIMSON]traitor[/color] returns with rebel scum."

prime_minister_idaho: "Did you think you could stop the progress of Spud? [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] is the lifeblood of this nation."

prime_minister_idaho: "But fret not. You'll still serve Spud... [color=DARK_VIOLET]in the processing vats![/color]"

prime_minister_idaho: "Oh, you [color=STEEL_BLUE]idealistic fool[/color]. You think this is a negotiation?"

prime_minister_idaho: Idaho smashes a button, and [color=RED]alarms begin blaring[/color]. "The only thing I'll be giving you is a [color=DARK_VIOLET]one-way trip to the fry vats![/color]"

sweet_potato_sasha: "I don't think so, Idaho. Guards! You saw the dossier, [color=YELLOW]you know what he did to your families.[/color]"

player_character: "Idaho, in the name of the potato people of Spud, [color=CHARTREUSE]you're under arrest![/color]"

sweet_potato_sasha: "It's over. The people have spoken. [color=CHARTREUSE]We'll build a new Spud where our roots are in the soil, not in suffering.[/color]"

player_character: "There will be [color=CRIMSON]no deals, no mercy[/color] for you, Idaho. A tyrant's justice is all you deserve."

player_character: "A reckoning. That's what I am. [color=CHARTREUSE]For every potato sacrificed, we take back our future![/color]"

player_character: "Forget him. He's a symptom, not the disease. [color=CHARTREUSE]Tear down every root and stem of this monstrosity.[/color]"

narrator: The fall of [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] sparks a wildfire of change across Spud.

narrator: Potatoes in every province rise up, embracing a [color=CHARTREUSE]new vision for their nation[/color].

sweet_potato_sasha: "As long as we stay true to our roots, to the ideals that brought us here... [color=CHARTREUSE]we'll find a way.[/color]"

narrator: And so, from the ashes of the old Spud, a [color=CHARTREUSE]new nation begins to take root[/color]. The Reign of [color=DARK_VIOLET]Root Reserve[/color] is over.

narrator: Welcome to [color=MEDIUM_VIOLET_RED]Spud Customs Training![/color]

narrator: Your duty is to process incoming potatoes at our border checkpoint.

narrator: This training will teach you the [color=DARK_ORANGE]essential skills[/color] needed to protect Spud's borders.

narrator: As a Customs Officer, you'll need to check documents carefully.

narrator: You'll signal each potato to approach your office by tapping the megaphone.

narrator: Look for [color=YELLOW]expired dates, incorrect information, or signs of forgery[/color].

narrator: Your desk has stamps for marking documents and a [color=CRIMSON]missile launcher to stop runners[/color].

narrator: Use your stamps to mark documents as [color=CHARTREUSE]approved[/color] or [color=CRIMSON]rejected[/color].

narrator: Sometimes, potatoes will try to [color=CRIMSON]rush past your checkpoint[/color].

narrator: Click on these "runners" to launch a missile and stop them.

narrator: Remember, each runner that gets through will count as a [color=CRIMSON]strike against you[/color].

narrator: Too many strikes, and your shift will end prematurely.

narrator: Each shift has a [color=DARK_ORANGE]quota of potatoes[/color] you need to process to finish your day.

narrator: Remember\: check documents carefully, stop runners, and meet your quota.
