Spud Customs Outline: 
Gameplay progresses in day cycles where you must process 10 immigrating spuds to complete the day. 

Each processing allows for 10 seconds to determine whether or not entry is allowed. 

There is a chance of a spud attemping to cross the border even after entry is disallowed. 

The player can attempt to peel these spuds for MAJOR BONUS POINTS. 

The UI should emulate Papers Please in it's presentation of decision making information, and flavor
text for spud profile. 

The player is only ever presented with two buttons, and the option to peel fleeing spuds. 

Create an alert box containing what conditions customs officers should look out for. (Rotten, Boiled, Mashed, Frozen)
