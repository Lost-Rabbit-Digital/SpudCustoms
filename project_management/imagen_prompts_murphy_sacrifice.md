## 1. Idaho Bunker Monitors
**File:** `idaho_bunker_monitors.png`

```
Underground bunker command center, wall of security monitors showing chaos and fire.
Central figure: authoritative anthropomorphic potato in dark suit (Prime Minister Idaho)
silhouetted against the screens. Multiple monitor feeds showing resistance fighters,
explosions, fleeing guards. Red and blue monitor glow illuminating the dark room.
Brutalist concrete architecture, military aesthetic. A large red button on the
console glows ominously. Style: dystopian surveillance state, cold calculated evil,
cinematic wide shot.
```

---

## 2. Amalgam Emergence
**File:** `amalgam_emergence.png`

```
Industrial facility floor EXPLODING upward, concrete and metal debris flying.
From the darkness of the pit below, massive tendrils of twisted organic matter
reaching up into the light. Red emergency lights flashing. Sparks and dust
filling the air. Workers/resistance fighters shown small in frame, scrambling
backward. The sense of something HUGE about to emerge. Style: horror movie reveal,
dramatic upward camera angle, motion blur on debris, apocalyptic tension.
```

---

## 3. Amalgam Reveal (HERO SHOT)
**File:** `amalgam_reveal.png`

```
Full reveal of THE AMALGAM: a massive nightmare creature made of fused potato matter,
15-20 feet tall. Dozens of frozen screaming faces embedded in its twisted mass -
the failed processing victims merged together. Root-like tendrils extending from
its body, grasping at machinery. Bioluminescent purple glow emanating from within
(Root Reserve chemicals). Industrial refinery background with tanks and pipes.
Style: Cronenberg body horror meets kaiju, grotesque beauty, the faces should
evoke pity and terror simultaneously. Backlit by emergency lights.
```

---

## 4. Team Horror
**File:** `team_horror.png`

```
Group shot of resistance fighters reacting to the Amalgam (monster off-screen).
Anthropomorphic potato characters in worn military/civilian clothing, weapons
raised but hands visibly shaking. Expressions of pure terror and disbelief.
One character (Sasha - female potato with determined eyes) stepping protectively
in front of others. Red emergency lighting casting harsh shadows on their faces.
Industrial backdrop. Style: ensemble reaction shot, horror movie lighting,
each face telling a story of fear.
```

---

## 5. Murphy Recognition
**File:** `murphy_recognition.png`

```
Close-up portrait of Murphy: male anthropomorphic potato in worn olive security
uniform, face pale with dawning realization. His hand touching a faded tattoo
on his forearm—a simple symbol of a potato with three roots extending downward.
Eyes fixed on something off-screen (the monster). Tears beginning to form. Soft focus
background showing purple glow and chaos. Style: intimate emotional moment
amid horror, shallow depth of field, the weight of recognition.
```

**Tattoo Symbol:** A small potato silhouette with three curved roots extending down - represents "staying grounded" and family bonds. Simple enough for a small tattoo, iconic enough to be recognizable.

---

## 6. Murphy Canister
**File:** `murphy_canister.png`

```
Murphy's hands holding a cylindrical metal canister, purple-tinged liquid visible
through a small window. Industrial label reads "RR-UTIL-7 - EXTRA DISTILLED" in
stark military font. Murphy's security uniform visible, olive fabric worn and
stained. Background blurred - red emergency lights, distant flames. The canister
glows slightly with unnatural purple luminescence. Style: object focus, dramatic
lighting, the mundane made horrifying - this canister contains a person.
```

---

## 7. Amalgam Advance
**File:** `amalgam_advance.png`

```
The Amalgam creature lurching forward, tendrils scraping against industrial
machinery, leaving gouges in metal. Refinery tanks visible in background -
clearly labeled "EXTRA DISTILLED" with hazard warnings. The creature's mass
blocking a doorway/corridor - the only path forward. Frozen faces in its body
seeming to look toward the viewer. Purple bioluminescence leaving trails.
Style: monster movie menace, claustrophobic framing, no escape visible.
```

---

## 8. Player Restrained (POV SHOT)
**File:** `player_restrained.png`

```
First-person POV: viewer's arms visible in frame, being held back by gloved
hands of resistance fighters. In the middle distance, Murphy's back as he
walks TOWARD the camera/viewer, toward the monster (implied off-screen above).
Other resistance members' faces visible at frame edges - grief, horror,
resignation. Motion blur suggesting struggle. Red and purple lighting.
Style: visceral POV, the helplessness of watching someone walk to their death.
```

---

## 9. Murphy's Stand (WIDE SHOT - Kong Parallel)
**File:** `murphy_stand.png`

```
Epic wide shot from behind Murphy: single anthropomorphic potato figure in
olive uniform, standing alone in vast industrial space. The canister visible
in his hand. Ahead of him, the massive Amalgam creature looms, mouth-like
opening in its mass. Scale difference emphasized - tiny figure vs enormous
monster. Industrial wasteland of broken machinery, purple-tinged fog,
refinery tanks lining the walls. Style: man vs monster, David vs Goliath,
cinematic widescreen composition, atmospheric perspective showing scale.
```

**Reference:** Kong: Skull Island - Cole facing the Skullcrawler

---

## 10. Murphy Arms Spread (ICONIC SHOT)
**File:** `murphy_arms_spread.png`

```
Murphy from behind, arms spread wide in cruciform pose, canister in one hand.
The Amalgam's horrible mass filling the frame ahead of him, tendrils reaching
toward him, frozen faces seeming to recognize him. Purple and red lighting
creating a halo effect around Murphy's silhouette. The moment before sacrifice.
Industrial cathedral of pipes and tanks framing the scene. Style: religious
iconography meets body horror, the hero's final stand, compositional symmetry.
```

**Reference:** Kong: Skull Island - Cole's iconic arms-spread moment before the Skullcrawler

---

## 11. Murphy Sacrifice Explosion (INITIAL)
**File:** `murphy_sacrifice_explosion.png`

```
The moment of impact: Murphy hurling the canister into the Amalgam's mass.
Purple-tinged explosion beginning to bloom. Murphy's silhouette visible
against the initial blast, arms still extended from the throw. The Amalgam
recoiling. Debris and organic matter flying outward. High contrast -
bright purple/white explosion against dark industrial background.
Style: freeze-frame action, the point of no return, tragic heroism.
```

---

## 12. Purple Explosion (FULL BLAST)
**File:** `purple_explosion.png`

```
Massive purple-tinged fireball engulfing both Murphy and part of the Amalgam.
Unnatural color - the Extra Distilled chemicals burning with violet and
magenta flames mixed with orange. Murphy no longer visible - consumed by
the blast. The Amalgam's mass partially obscured by fire and smoke.
Shockwave visible, debris flying. Industrial backdrop lit by the explosion.
Style: Michael Bay meets chemical fire, beautiful destruction, the cost of heroism.
```

---

## 13. Amalgam Wounded
**File:** `amalgam_wounded.png`

```
The Amalgam still standing but visibly wounded. Burning patches across its
surface, purple flames licking at its mass. Some of the frozen faces now
slack, released. But it's STILL ALIVE - tendrils still moving, still
advancing. The horror that Murphy's sacrifice wasn't enough. Smoke and
embers filling the air. Refinery tanks visible in background, ominously close.
Style: the monster survives, hope crushed, dread building.
```

---

## 14. Chain Reaction
**File:** `chain_reaction.png`

```
The wounded, burning Amalgam crashing into refinery tanks labeled "EXTRA DISTILLED".
Metal rupturing, purple liquid spraying. Warning lights and alarms visualized
(flashing red, WARNING text on displays). The beginning of catastrophic failure.
Other tanks visible, a domino effect about to begin. Resistance fighters in
foreground diving for cover. Style: disaster movie, the moment before everything
goes wrong (right), industrial catastrophe.
```

---

## 15. Tower Collapse
**File:** `tower_collapse.png`

```
The refinery tower structure beginning to collapse inward. Multiple explosions
climbing up the structure - orange and purple fireballs. The Amalgam beneath,
looking up as tons of steel and concrete begin to fall toward it. Structural
beams buckling, glass shattering, pipes rupturing. The scale is massive -
the tower dwarfs even the monster. Style: controlled demolition meets kaiju death,
the architecture of oppression falling.
```

---

## 16. Massive Explosion (HERO EXPLOSION)
**File:** `massive_explosion.png`

```
APOCALYPTIC explosion - the entire refinery section erupting. Chain reaction
of every Extra Distilled tank detonating simultaneously. Hundreds of batches.
Hundreds of victims finally released. Purple and orange mushroom cloud rising.
The Amalgam barely visible at the base, being consumed and crushed.
Debris flying into a dawn sky - the first hint of sunrise on the horizon.
Style: nuclear-level devastation, cathartic destruction, Tommy started this,
the lost ones finished it. Beautiful and terrible.
```

---

## 17. Murphy Badge Memorial (INTIMATE SHOT)
**File:** `murphy_badge_memorial.png`

```
Extreme close-up: Murphy's charred security badge lying on rubble and ash,
the name "MURPHY" barely legible through soot and damage. Beside it, pushing
through a crack in the concrete, a single bright green potato sprout - new
life emerging from sacrifice. Shallow depth of field, embers glowing softly
in the blurred background. Dawn light catching the sprout's leaves.
Style: intimate memorial, symbolic rebirth, bittersweet hope, the small
beauty in devastation.
```

**Transition:** This intimate shot holds for a beat before pulling out to the wide aftermath.

---

## 18. Aftermath Rubble
**File:** `aftermath_rubble.png`

```
Wide aftermath shot: smoking rubble where the tower and Amalgam stood. Dust and
ash settling like snow. Embers floating in the air. Dawn light breaking through
the smoke clouds, painting the scene in soft gold and pink. The path to Idaho's
bunker visible - a heavy door labeled "IDAHO'S BUNKER" standing intact amid
the destruction. The sprout from the previous shot now visible as a tiny green
dot in the foreground rubble. Style: aftermath of battle, somber beauty,
hope through devastation, the silence after thunder.
```

---

## Supplementary Shots (Optional)

### The Faces at Peace
```
Detail shot of the rubble where the Amalgam fell. Among the debris, fragments
that were once faces - but now they look peaceful, released. No longer
screaming. Perhaps a hint of smiles. Purple glow fading.
Style: bittersweet resolution, the victims finally at rest.
```

---

## Technical Notes

- All backgrounds should be generated at minimum 1920x1080 resolution
- Maintain consistent character design for Murphy across all shots
- The Amalgam should have consistent design - multiple fused potato bodies, root tendrils, purple bioluminescence
- Emergency lighting (red) should be consistent throughout the sequence
- Purple (Root Reserve color) should be a unifying visual element
