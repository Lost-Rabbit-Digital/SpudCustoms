# SPUD CUSTOMS 1.2.0 - PATCH NOTES

## A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE DEVELOPER
This update is dedicated to my little one, who spent the first months of life in the NICU - from 1lb at birth to now 20lbs of pure joy. Thank you to everyone who has joined this journey - over 2,000 players have now experienced Spud Customs!
