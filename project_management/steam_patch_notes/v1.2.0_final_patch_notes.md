# SPUD CUSTOMS 1.2.0 - PATCH NOTES

*The "Two Years Later" Update*

---

## A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE DEVELOPER

My son Kobi was born 25 weeks premature in late November 2023, weighing barely 1 pound. I'd been delaying the launch week after week, and finally decided to release whatever I could muster the willpower to finish while we were checking into the NICU.

Now, two years later, he's thriving at nearly 25 pounds. He's home with us now, breathing on his own, crawling everywhere, and getting into everything he shouldn't. Those quiet NICU hours where I worked on Spud Customs between visits feel like another lifetime - yet every line of code still carries that weight.

A lot of the new content reflects themes that emerged from my experiences - Viktor's rooftop grief, Murphy's sacrifice, the old queer couple's erasure, the negative impact of thoughtless acts performed as social norm, and the helplessness in face of waves of ongoing disasters. I watch every recording that pops up online, and I'm grateful to each of you who've taken the time to experience this strange little world.

Over 2,000 people have played Spud Customs and joined us on this journey. Thank you for your feedback, your patience, and your interest in our little story of potato redemption.

I hope this game can bloom even a fraction as much as Kobi has.

One small tribute: the elderly traveler Jen Piper is named after one of the NICU nurses who cared for Kobi during those early months. Thank you, Jen.

This update is for you.
