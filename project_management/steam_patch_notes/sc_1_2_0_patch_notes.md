Spud Customs 1.2.0 Notes:
Incorporate animated GIFs from StagNation into opening scenes
Make sure that narrative choices are carrying across levels
Add visual signs of progression into the main gameplay scene based on shift #
Repaint first five scenes of art player sees in Spud Customs:
Main menu (border_chaos_1)
Tutorial (checkpoint_interior x 2)
Shift 1 Intro (nation of spud, checkpoint interior, great wall of spud, supervisor presenting)
Shift 1 End (root reserve customs office, suspicious note, questioning identity)
Shift 2 Intro (meeting sasha, potato radio, propaganda 1, propaganda 2, propaganda 3)
Change background as difficulty increases
background disappearing during dialogue scenes
Done: Leaderboard is stuck at loading leaderboard data and "submitting" on the submit score button, with the button faded out
Done: Fixing easy scaling factor to 0.8 instead of 0.1
Loyalty choice for scanner / reality scan sequence is triggering both paths, maybe around ep 5
All officers, line up for security scanning <- The background is missing during this exchange
Legal representative option triggering when no legal represenative chosen during security testing <-- Background missing
Sweet Potato Sasha scene "The Traitor will be" cannot be read because of the coloration
Done: Screen shake needs to reset to origin after each invocation, the screen is going way off-center with time
Done: Something wrong with achievements, I unlocked "Tater of Justice" but others are locked, something's not OK because there's achievement for complete your first shift but it's still locked 🤔
Fix branching dialogue scene in final narratives
Fix translations
