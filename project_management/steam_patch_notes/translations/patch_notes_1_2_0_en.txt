[h1]Spud Customs v1.2.0 - The "One Year Later" Update[/h1]

[i]A personal note from the developer:[/i]

My son was born 25 weeks premature in late November, weighing barely 1 pound. I'd been delaying the launch week after week, and finally decided to just release whatever I could muster the willpower to finish while we were checking into the NICU.

Now, over a year later, he's grown from 1 pound to over 20 pounds - still in the NICU, but so much stronger. In the quiet hours between visits, I've been working to bring Spud Customs closer to the vision I had before life took an unexpected turn. I hope this game can bloom even a fraction as much as he has.

Over 2,000 people have played Spud Customs and joined us on this journey. Thank you for your feedback, your patience, and your interest in our little story of potato redemption.

This update is for you.
