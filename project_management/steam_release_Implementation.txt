To implement the Steam release requirements in the provided script, we'll need to make several additions and modifications. Here's a plan to address each requirement:


6. Steam Integration:
   - Add Steam achievement tracking:
```gdscript
func unlock_achievement(achievement_name):
	if OS.has_feature("Steam"):
		Steam.unlock_achievement(achievement_name)

# Call this function when appropriate conditions are met
# e.g., unlock_achievement("FIRST_POTATO_PROCESSED")
```

7. Localization:
   - Use Godot's built-in localization system:
```gdscript
func _ready():
	TranslationServer.set_locale("en")  # Default to English

func change_language(locale):
	TranslationServer.set_locale(locale)
```

To create separate Steam and non-Steam versions:
1. Use Godot's export features to create two separate export configurations.
2. Use conditional compilation to include or exclude Steam-specific code:

```gdscript
const STEAM_BUILD = true  # Set this to false for the non-Steam version

func _ready():
	if STEAM_BUILD and OS.has_feature("Steam"):
		Steam.init()
		# Initialize other Steam-specific features

Remember to implement the actual functionality for these new features, create new scenes and UI elements as needed, and thoroughly test each new addition. This outline provides a starting point for incorporating the Steam release requirements into your existing codebase.
