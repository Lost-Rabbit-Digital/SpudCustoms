I'll help you implement a solution to play a GIF animation instead of a static PNG in your Dialogic timeline. Based on the project structure and code I see in your files, I'll provide a detailed approach that works with Godot 4.4 and your existing systems.

## Implementation Options

There are several approaches you could take to display an animated GIF in Dialogic:

### Option 1: Use AnimatedTexture in Dialogic

Dialogic supports showing images during conversations, but by default it only supports static images. However, we can create an AnimatedTexture resource that contains frames from your GIF.

```gdscript
# Create an AnimatedTexture with frames from your GIF
var animated_texture = AnimatedTexture.new()
animated_texture.frames = frame_count  # Number of frames in your GIF
# Add each frame
for i in range(frame_count):
    animated_texture.set_frame_texture(i, load("res://assets/narrative/great_wall_of_spud_frame_" + str(i) + ".png"))
    animated_texture.set_frame_delay(i, 0.1)  # Adjust delay between frames as needed
```

### Option 2: Custom Dialogic Event for GIF Playback

You could create a custom Dialogic event that plays GIFs. This would involve:

1. Creating a custom event extension for Dialogic
2. Implementing GIF loading and playback
3. Adding custom events to your timeline

### Option 3: Modify Dialogic's Existing Image Event (Recommended)

The most straightforward approach would be to extend Dialogic's existing image event to support AnimatedSprite2D nodes for animations:

## Recommended Implementation

Let's implement option 3 as it's the most integrated with your existing setup:

1. First, create an AnimatedSprite2D scene:

```gdscript
# Create a new file: res://assets/narrative/animated_wall_of_spud.tscn

[gd_scene load_steps=N format=3 uid="..."]

[ext_resource type="Texture2D" uid="..." path="res://assets/narrative/great_wall_of_spud_frame_1.png" id="1"]
[ext_resource type="Texture2D" uid="..." path="res://assets/narrative/great_wall_of_spud_frame_2.png" id="2"]
# Add more frames as needed

[sub_resource type="SpriteFrames" id="SpriteFrames_xyz"]
animations = [{
"frames": [{
"duration": 1.0,
"texture": ExtResource("1")
}, {
"duration": 1.0,
"texture": ExtResource("2")
}, 
# More frames here
],
"loop": true,
"name": &"default",
"speed": 5.0
}]

[node name="AnimatedWallOfSpud" type="AnimatedSprite2D"]
sprite_frames = SubResource("SpriteFrames_xyz")
autoplay = "default"
```

2. Then use Dialogic's scene display feature instead of the image feature:

```
# In your shift1_intro.dtl file, replace:
[image=great_wall_of_spud.png]

# With:
[scene path="res://assets/narrative/animated_wall_of_spud.tscn"]
```

If your Dialogic version doesn't support the scene event, you can use a custom event:

```gdscript
# In a custom Dialogic event script:
var animation_scene = load("res://assets/narrative/animated_wall_of_spud.tscn").instantiate()
dialogic_node.add_child(animation_scene)
# Add code to position it appropriately
```

## Alternative Quick Solution

If you prefer a quicker solution without creating new files, you could create an AnimatedSprite2D directly in your NarrativeManager script and display it when needed:

```gdscript
# In NarrativeManager.gd, add:

func _on_dialogic_signal(argument):
    # Your existing signal code...
    
    if argument == "show_wall_animation":
        show_animated_wall()

func show_animated_wall():
    var animated_sprite = AnimatedSprite2D.new()
    var frames = SpriteFrames.new()
    
    # Add your frames
    var textures = []
    for i in range(1, 6):  # Adjust based on frame count
        textures.append(load("res://assets/narrative/great_wall_of_spud_frame_" + str(i) + ".png"))
    
    frames.add_animation("default")
    for i in range(textures.size()):
        frames.add_frame("default", textures[i])
    
    animated_sprite.sprite_frames = frames
    animated_sprite.animation = "default"
    animated_sprite.playing = true
    
    # Set position
    animated_sprite.position = Vector2(640, 360)  # Center of screen
    
    add_child(animated_sprite)
    
    # Remove after animation completes
    await get_tree().create_timer(3.0).timeout  # Adjust timing
    animated_sprite.queue_free()
```

Then in your DTL file:
```
[signal=show_wall_animation]
```

## Conclusion

The AnimatedSprite2D approach is the most compatible with your existing Godot 4.4 codebase. You'll need to:

1. Extract the frames from your GIF
2. Create either a scene with an AnimatedSprite2D or add code to create one dynamically
3. Update your Dialogic timeline to use it
