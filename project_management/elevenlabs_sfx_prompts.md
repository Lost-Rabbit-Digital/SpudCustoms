## 🎨 Sound Design Notes

**Tone:** The game has a dystopian but slightly comedic tone (Papers Please meets potato people). Sounds should be:
- Professional and office-like for official actions (stamps, documents)
- Playful and cartoonish for potato interactions (emotes, wiggles)
- Satisfying and tactile for UI feedback (clicks, hovers)
- Retro/vintage for the 1960s-inspired setting (mechanical sounds)

**Volume:** All SFX should be normalized and balanced. UI sounds should be subtle, gameplay sounds more prominent.

**Format:** Export as MP3 for smaller file size, or WAV 44.1kHz 16-bit for best quality in Godot.
