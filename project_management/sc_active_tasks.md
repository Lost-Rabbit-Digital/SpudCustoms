# Spud Customs Active Tasks
These are my, BodenGameDev, tasks which I'm currently working on.
I will move the tasks to the scratch_pad completed section when the task has been completed.


## Stretch Goals
- At the beginning of your shift, see your potato character walk into the customs office
- Menu Audio: Tick sounds when adjusting volume sliders
- Environment: Cars passing by
- Office Shutter / Bug: Fade out the foreground shadow when the potatoes leave the office
- Office Shutter / Bug: Do not fade out transparency of potato when enter or leaving office, only the foreground shadow
- Emote System: If you click the same potato 3+ times they get angry and show POPPING_VEINS emote
- Emote System / Bug: Dot animation only shows one dots then stops
	- Move animation to 1.0.3

## Graphics
- Passport: The shadow is still on the spud for the picture, is this a bug or should it be visually enhanced? 
- Explosions appear above the inspection table
- Potato footsteps appear above the customs office
- Potato gibs appear below the screen borders

- Cursor: After dragging a document the cursor returns to default even if the cursor is still hovering over a document 
- Cursor: Update cusor to work with Maaacks menu

## Megaphone Dialogue System
