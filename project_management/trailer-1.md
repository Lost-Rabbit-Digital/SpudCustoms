## TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Keep total runtime under 30 seconds for maximum impact
- Use in-game assets for authenticity
- Maintain consistent visual style between shots
- Use sound design to emphasize transitions (alarms, stamps, explosions)
- Consider a slight film grain or VHS effect to match the dystopian theme
- End with Steam page link or other call-to-action
