Update tutorial step with exploding runner
Update where strikes and quota show on UI
Create updated versions of each tutorial step with the new UI
tutorial, needs updated images
Keyboard audio desync when using pre-made audio files, change to use dialogic single keystrokes or tailored length files

shift1_intro, Split Supervisor Russet, "And remember, Glory to Spud!"

shift1_end
Letter or receipt document as "Character" talking to you? May be interesting

shift1_intro, some fades are too fast especially since dialogue is much briefer
Split "I think I know what's happening..." "They're becoming [shake][color=light purple]Root Reserve[/shake][/color]"
Reworded "Anyone flagged faces" to "Anyone triggering the scanner will face"
shift10, confusing narrative change from resistance members in the "stay" path being ground up to instead approaching the capitol

color match purple of background in personal quarters

shift10 needs the most re-work/narrative bridge

Dialogue font needs to be different
