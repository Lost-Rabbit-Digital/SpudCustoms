To present a compelling story mode lasting about 2 hours with the given parameters, you can structure it as follows:

1. Story Structure:
   - Divide the story into chapters or days
   - Each chapter/day represents a shift at the customs office
   - Aim for 8-10 chapters/days to fill the 2-hour playtime

2. Story Presentation:
   - Short cutscenes or dialogue sequences between chapters
   - In-game events and conversations during potato processing
   - Notes or memos that appear on the bulletin board
   - Radio broadcasts or newspaper headlines in the background

3. Pacing:
   - Each chapter/day could last about 15 minutes
   - Process about 20-25 potatoes per chapter (at 40 seconds each)
   - Allow 2-3 minutes for story elements between chapters

Here's a suggested implementation:

```gdscript
var current_chapter = 0
var potatoes_processed_in_chapter = 0
var max_potatoes_per_chapter = 25
var story_events = [
	# Array of story events, one per chapter
]

func start_story_mode():
	current_chapter = 0
	start_new_chapter()

func start_new_chapter():
	current_chapter += 1
	potatoes_processed_in_chapter = 0
	present_chapter_intro()
	update_rules_and_difficulty()

func present_chapter_intro():
	# Show a cutscene or dialogue sequence
	var story_scene = load("res://scenes/story/chapter_" + str(current_chapter) + "_intro.tscn").instance()
	add_child(story_scene)
	# Wait for scene to finish, then start gameplay

func update_rules_and_difficulty():
	# Adjust rules and difficulty based on current chapter
	if current_chapter > 3:
		set_difficulty("Normal")
	if current_chapter > 7:
		set_difficulty("Hard")
	generate_rules()

func process_decision(allowed):
	# Existing decision processing logic
	potatoes_processed_in_chapter += 1
	
	if potatoes_processed_in_chapter >= max_potatoes_per_chapter:
		end_chapter()

func end_chapter():
	present_chapter_outro()
	if current_chapter < story_events.size():
		start_new_chapter()
	else:
		end_story_mode()

func present_chapter_outro():
	# Show end-of-day summary, story progression, etc.
	var outro_scene = load("res://scenes/story/chapter_" + str(current_chapter) + "_outro.tscn").instance()
	add_child(outro_scene)

func end_story_mode():
	# Show game ending, credits, etc.
	pass

func _process(delta):
	if is_story_mode and is_potato_in_office:
		check_for_story_events()

func check_for_story_events():
	# Check if any story events should trigger based on current state
	for event in story_events[current_chapter]:
		if event.should_trigger():
			trigger_story_event(event)

func trigger_story_event(event):
	match event.type:
		"dialogue":
			show_dialogue(event.content)
		"bulletin_note":
			add_bulletin_note(event.content)
		"radio_broadcast":
			play_radio_broadcast(event.content)
		"newspaper_headline":
			update_newspaper_headline(event.content)

func show_dialogue(content):
	# Implement dialogue system
	pass

func add_bulletin_note(content):
	# Add note to bulletin board
	pass

func play_radio_broadcast(content):
	# Play audio and/or show subtitles
	pass

func update_newspaper_headline(content):
	# Update in-game newspaper prop
	pass
```

This structure allows you to:

1. Control the pacing of the story by dividing it into chapters.
2. Gradually increase difficulty as the story progresses.
3. Inject story elements both between and during gameplay.
4. Maintain the core gameplay loop while adding narrative elements.

To flesh out the story:

1. Create a narrative that spans the 8-10 chapters, with each chapter having a mini-arc.
2. Design story events that can occur during potato processing (e.g., a suspicious potato that ties into the main plot).
3. Write dialogue and cutscenes for the intros and outros of each chapter.
4. Develop background elements like radio broadcasts and newspaper headlines that subtly advance the plot.
5. Consider adding character development for the customs officer (player character) and recurring potato characters.

Remember to allow players to skip story elements if they wish, and consider adding a "Story Recap" feature in the pause menu for players who want to refresh their memory on the plot.
