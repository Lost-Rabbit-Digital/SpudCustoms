Hi there, 

Thank you for your time and willingness to test my game, Spud Customs. 

You can play the game directly in the browser, or download it locally here: https://lost-rabbit-digital.itch.io/spud-customs

I programmed this game in 72 hours for the 2024 Ludum Dare 56 game jam and I'm considering expanding it into a full Steam release.

I appreciate your expertise and look forward to your feedback. 

Please focus on testing the following aspects of the game:

Potato processing workflow:

Test the megaphone functionality to call in new potatoes
Verify that potato information is correctly displayed in the passport
Check if the stamp application process works smoothly (both approval and rejection stamps)
Ensure the potato exits correctly based on the stamp applied


Game mechanics:

Test if the score and strikes are updating correctly
Verify that the game ends appropriately after 5 strikes
Check if the game transitions to the win scene when the score reaches a multiple of 25


User interface interactions:

Test dragging and dropping of passports and bulletin
Verify that opening and closing animations for passports and bulletin work correctly
Check if the sound effects play at appropriate times (e.g., stamp sounds, customs officer phrases)


Rule system:

Verify that new rules are generated and displayed correctly
Test if the game correctly identifies valid and invalid potatoes based on the current rules


Queue management:

Check if new potatoes are spawning correctly in the queue
Verify that the queue moves properly when potatoes are processed


Visual elements:

Ensure that potato textures and animations are displaying correctly
Check for any visual glitches or misalignments in the UI


Performance:

Test for any lag or frame rate issues, especially when multiple animations are playing


Edge cases:

Try rapidly clicking buttons or dragging multiple objects simultaneously
Test what happens if you try to process a potato without applying a stamp

Please document any bugs, glitches, or areas for improvement you encounter during testing. 

Your thorough evaluation will help me refine and enhance the game experience. 

Thank you again for your assistance!
