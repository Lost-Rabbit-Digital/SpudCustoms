Spud Customs 1.2.0 Notes:
Incorporate animated GIFs from StagNation into opening scenes
Make sure that narrative choices are carrying across levels
Add visual signs of progression into the main gameplay scene based on shift #
Repaint first five scenes of art player sees in Spud Customs: 
Main menu (border_chaos_1)
Tutorial (checkpoint_interior x 2)
Shift 1 Intro (nation of spud, checkpoint interior, great wall of spud, supervisor presenting)
Shift 1 End (root reserve customs office, suspicious note, questioning identity)
Shift 2 Intro (meeting sasha, potato radio, propaganda 1, propaganda 2, propaganda 3)
Change background as difficulty increases
background disappearing during dialogue scenes
Leaderboard is stuck at loading leaderboard data and "submitting" on the submit score button, with the button faded out
Fixing easy scaling factor to 0.8 instead of 0.1
Loyalty choice for scanner / reality scan sequence is triggering both paths, maybe around ep 5
All officers, line up for security scanning <- The background is missing during this exchange
Legal representative option triggering when no legal represenative chosen during security testing <-- Background missing
Sweet Potato Sasha scene "The Traitor will be" cannot be read because of the coloration
Done: Screen shake needs to reset to origin after each invocation, the screen is going way off-center with time
Something wrong with achievements, I unlocked "Tater of Justice" but others are locked, something's not OK because there's achievement for complete your first shift but it's still locked ðŸ¤”
Fix branching dialogue scene in final narratives
Fix translations
