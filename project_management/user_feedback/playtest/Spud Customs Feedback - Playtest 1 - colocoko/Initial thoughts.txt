Lol is this a game about potato immigration? Nice. Graphics and sound are both good. Tutorial is kinda funny.
Okay i made a strike but now i know what to do. The sounds are funny.
Wait... did one of the rejected potatos get in by sneaking? lol funny. IDK If its a bug but it seems that sometimes a rejected
potato will still run inside.

I feel like having one law say reject expiring within 1 year and another say reject expiring within 6 months... that makes them
redundant. {CHECK THE PICTURE CALLED "REDUNDANT"}



Okay I won. It says you have let 25 permitted citizens but i was getting scores for rejections as well. You might want to change the
message to something like "you have made 25 correct decisions" Alternatively, you can give score only for correct admissions and
give nothing for rejections (even the correct rejections)

Lets try the next shift.

Ahh i finally managed to catch the video of an illegal that still gets in. {CHECK THE VIDEO CALLED ILLEGAL POTATO}

Again i feel that one rule saying expired potato arent allowed and another saying 6 months to expiry arent allowed is redundant.
This is only a small nitpick. Nothing big. You can keep it if you want but maybe you can randomise better. Just sayin haha.

All right i have done 50 now. I think thats enough.

Now to check 5 strikes:

Yeah it works.


{THE END}
