Text effect implementation notes

## shift1_intro.dtl
```
narrator: Welcome to the nation of Spud. [pulse freq=0.7 color=#ffffff60]A land of prosperity for all potatoes.[/pulse]

supervisor_russet: I appoint you as a Customs Officer of [pulse freq=1.0 color=#ffff0050]glorious Spud[/pulse]. Any questions?

supervisor_russet: Meet your quota, avoid strikes. [wave amp=15.0 freq=3.0]Glory to Spud![/wave]
```

## shift1_end.dtl
```
supervisor_russet: Don't forget to grab your ration of Root Reserve. [pulse freq=1.0 color=#00ff0040]"It's the flavor of Spud's future!"[/pulse]

A small note slips out: [shake rate=10.0 level=2]"Not all is as it seems. The roots of our nation have grown rotten. Follow the trail, but take care not to be silenced. - A friend"[/shake]

player_character: That note... and the way Russet dodged my question about rejected potatoes... [pulse freq=0.8 color=#ff000030]Something feels off.[/pulse]
```

## shift2_intro.dtl
```
sweet_potato_sasha: Sasha leans in close: [shake rate=8.0 level=2]"And keep your eyes peeled. Not everything is as it seems in Spud."[/shake]

supervisor_russet: Remember, a dutiful officer has nothing to fear. [wave amp=15.0 freq=2.0]Those who abandon their duty abandon their roots.[/wave]

announcer: [pulse freq=1.5 color=#ff000030]"In other news, reports of missing potatoes continue. Authorities assure no connection..."[/pulse]
```

## shift3_intro.dtl
```
supervisor_russet: [pulse freq=1.2 color=#ff000040]New orders from the top. We're doubling rejections.[/pulse] Any potato deemed unsafe is detained immediately.

security_officer: Their voice drops ominously. [shake rate=10.0 level=2]We have special procedures for those individuals.[/shake]

npc_3: [wave amp=15.0 freq=2.0]Please, I beg you! My wife was supposed to be right behind me, but she never made it through customs.[/wave]
```

## shift3_end.dtl
```
sweet_potato_sasha: I've been gathering information about rejected potatoes. [shake rate=12.0 level=2]They don't go to deportation centers.[/shake]

sweet_potato_sasha: [shake rate=15.0 level=3]I think I know what's happening. They're becoming Root Reserve.[/shake]

sweet_potato_sasha: [pulse freq=1.5 color=#ff000040]Cannibalism with extra steps. That's what Root Reserve is.[/pulse] And we've been helping select their ingredients.

player_character: You hide the folder inside your jacket. Root Reserve. The rejections. The missing potatoes. [tornado radius=3.0 freq=0.8]It all connects in a horrifying way.[/tornado]
```

## shift4_intro.dtl
```
supervisor_russet: [pulse freq=1.2 color=#ff000030]New security protocols today. We've received intelligence about suspicious activities.[/pulse]

fellow_officer: Have you tried the new Premium Reserve? My cousin disappeared last month. Failed inspection.
[shake rate=12.0 level=2]Maybe he's part of this batch, huh? Dark humor, you know?[/shake]

sweet_potato_sasha: [wave amp=15.0 freq=2.5]I have something that might help us. Some potatoes with vital information deserve to get through.[/wave]
```

## shift5_intro.dtl
```
supervisor_russet: [pulse freq=1.5 color=#ff000040]Last night, prohibited materials were discovered. Pamphlets containing lies about Root Reserve.[/pulse]

sweet_potato_sasha: [shake rate=10.0 level=2]I think I know what's happening. They're becoming Root Reserve.[/shake]

supervisor_russet: [wave amp=20.0 freq=3.0]The traitors will be rooted out. I guarantee it.[/wave]
```

## shift5_end.dtl
```
player_character: You find the thick red folder labeled "RR Transport" in the filing cabinet.
[shake rate=15.0 level=3]Inside are manifests matching rejected potato counts, and a directive from Prime Minister Idaho authorizing "full utilization of border rejects for RR production."[/shake]

Footsteps approach the office door. [pulse freq=2.0 color=#ff000050]"Strange, I could've sworn I locked this."[/pulse]

sweet_potato_sasha: [wave amp=25.0 freq=4.0]"This proves everything. The resistance will make copies. Spread the truth everywhere. They can't silence us all."[/wave]
```

## shift6_intro.dtl
```
supervisor_russet: [pulse freq=2.0 color=#ff000050]ATTENTION! LEVEL RED security situation! Classified documents were stolen last night.[/pulse]

security_officer: [shake rate=15.0 level=3]All officers, line up for security scanning. Those with elevated stress responses will be flagged.[/shake]

fellow_officer: [wave amp=15.0 freq=2.5]Have you seen what's happening outside? Pamphlets everywhere showing Root Reserve is made from... from us.[/wave]

sweet_potato_sasha: [tornado radius=4.0 freq=0.9]We're way past that point. Laying low won't save us. Only bringing down the system will.[/tornado]
```

## shift7_intro.dtl
```
sweet_potato_sasha: [shake rate=15.0 level=3]This isn't just a food supplement program. They're processing potatoes...and not in a good way.[/shake]

player_character: [pulse freq=1.5 color=#ff000040]Internal memos from Prime Minister Idaho himself, authorizing the "utilization of rejected assets."[/pulse]

announcer: [wave amp=25.0 freq=4.0]EMERGENCY BROADCAST: Recent circulation of forged documents has caused unnecessary panic.[/wave]

supervisor_russet: [tornado radius=4.0 freq=0.8]The traitor in our midst will be found. And when they are...[/tornado] [draws finger across throat]

sweet_potato_sasha: [pulse freq=1.7 color=#ffff0040]"Your decision was noticed. Be ready. Something big is coming. The resistance is planning a direct action."[/pulse]
```

## shift7_end.dtl
```
resistance_leader: [wave amp=20.0 freq=3.0]The time for whispers and pamphlets is over. The government has shown its true colors.[/wave]

resistance_leader: [shake rate=15.0 level=3]Which means more of our brothers and sisters disappeared, processed, consumed.[/shake]

resistance_leader: [pulse freq=2.0 color=#ff000040]This ends now. We have a plan to strike at the heart of their operation.[/pulse]

resistance_leader: [pulse freq=1.5 color=#ffff0050]The leader clasps your shoulder firmly. Your courage honors us all.[/pulse]

sweet_potato_sasha: [tornado radius=4.0 freq=0.8]Whatever happens... thank you for everything you've done.[/tornado]
```

## shift8_intro.dtl
```
security_chief: [pulse freq=2.0 color=#ff000050]Intelligence indicates a terrorist attack is imminent. The "resistance" plans to infiltrate tomorrow.[/pulse]

security_chief: [wave amp=20.0 freq=3.0]All officers will submit to loyalty screening. Suspicious behavior means detention and processing.[/wave]

supervisor_russet: [shake rate=12.0 level=3]Russet's gaze lingers on you uncomfortably before moving on.[/shake]

security_chief: [tornado radius=5.0 freq=0.8]Multiple witnesses say otherwise. Without concrete evidence though, I can't detain you. Yet.[/tornado]
```

## shift9_intro.dtl
```
narrator: [pulse freq=1.5 color=#ff000040]The border resembles a war zone. Barricades, armored vehicles, and elite guards stand ready. Today is when the resistance planned to strike.[/pulse]

announcer: [wave amp=30.0 freq=4.0]EMERGENCY BROADCAST: All of Spud is under martial law. "The Resistance" has launched attacks against government facilities.[/wave]

sweet_potato_sasha: [shake rate=20.0 level=4]The real traitors are those who feed our people to each other. You can't stop the truth![/shake]

supervisor_russet: [tornado radius=6.0 freq=1.0]The traitor will be processed immediately. A special batch of Root Reserve, made from the terrorists themselves.[/tornado]

narrator: [pulse freq=2.5 color=#ff000050]Suddenly, the facility shakes with explosions. The resistance attack has begun, regardless of your choice.[/pulse]
```

## shift9_end.dtl
```
player_character: [shake rate=15.0 level=3]You abandon your post and race toward the fighting. The time for caution is over.[/shake]

resistance_fighter: [pulse freq=2.0 color=#ff000040]"Prove you're with us! How do you know Sasha?"[/pulse]

player_character: [wave amp=25.0 freq=3.5]"The doors blast open, revealing the horrific truth - grinding machines, conveyors carrying potatoes to their doom.[/wave]

supervisor_russet: [tornado radius=6.0 freq=1.2]"YOU! I should have known you were one of them! Back away or I start the processor!"[/tornado]

sweet_potato_sasha: [pulse freq=2.5 color=#00ff0050]"You came back for me. We did it. The truth is out there now. We have a future to build!"[/pulse]
```

## shift10_intro.dtl
```
supervisor_russet: [pulse freq=1.5 color=#ffff0040]"I've been promoted to Regional Director of Border Security and Root Reserve Distribution."[/pulse]

npc_1: [shake rate=15.0 level=3]"Some are saying the resistance wasn't completely wrong. That there's evidence they were telling the truth..."[/shake]

npc_1: [wave amp=20.0 freq=3.0]"There's a new resistance forming. Quieter, more careful. If you want to know more... watch for the yellow spud emblem."[/wave]

sweet_potato_sasha: [tornado radius=5.0 freq=1.0]"You saved my life at the processing plant. Now we have a chance to save all of Spud."[/tornado]
```

## final_confrontation.dtl
```
narrator: [pulse freq=2.0 color=#ff000040]The Spud border is in chaos. Panicked potatoes flood checkpoints, desperate to escape after the leaked documents.[/pulse]

sweet_potato_sasha: [wave amp=25.0 freq=3.5]"They can't silence the truth any longer. If we can infiltrate the Root Reserve facility and broadcast evidence, it'll ignite the revolution."[/wave]

prime_minister_idaho: [shake rate=20.0 level=4]"Did you think you could stop the progress of Spud? Root Reserve is the lifeblood of this nation."[/shake]

player_character: [tornado radius=6.0 freq=1.2]"It's over, Idaho. Your secrets are exposed. How this ends... that's up to you."[/tornado]

sweet_potato_sasha: [pulse freq=2.0 color=#00ff0050]"As long as we stay true to our roots, to the ideals that brought us here... we'll find a way."[/pulse]

narrator: [wave amp=30.0 freq=2.0]And so, from the ashes of the old Spud, a new nation begins to take root. The Reign of Root Reserve is over.[/wave]
```

## Tutorial.dtl
I recommend using more subtle effects in the tutorial to introduce players to text styling without overwhelming them:

```
narrator: [pulse freq=0.7 color=#ffffff60]Welcome to Spud Customs Training![/pulse]

narrator: [wave amp=10.0 freq=2.0]Your duty is to process incoming potatoes at our border checkpoint.[/wave]

narrator: The safety and security of Spud depends on [shake rate=8.0 level=2]your vigilance![/shake]
```

## Implementation Tips

1. **Progressive Intensity**: Notice how I've made the effects more dramatic as the story progresses - this creates a sense of escalating tension.

2. **Character-Specific Effects**:
   - Use shake effects for Sasha when revealing conspiracies
   - Use wave effects for resistance fighters' passionate speeches
   - Use pulse effects for announcements and broadcasts
   - Use tornado effects for the most climactic threats and revelations

3. **Context-Appropriate Effects**:
   - Shake: fear, nervousness, urgency, horror
   - Wave: passion, emotional appeals, uncertainty
   - Pulse: emphasis, propaganda, warnings
   - Tornado: extreme emotions, turning points, climactic confrontations

4. **Technical Consideration**: Test these effects with your font to ensure readability is maintained. You may need to adjust the parameters slightly based on your specific font and text size.
