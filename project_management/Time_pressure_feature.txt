The ideal time for processing a potato through customs should balance engagement, challenge, and a sense of urgency without causing frustration. Here are some considerations:

1. Game Feel: Aim for a pace that feels brisk and keeps the player engaged, but not so fast that it becomes stressful or impossible to keep up.

2. Difficulty Levels: The time could vary based on difficulty:
   - Easy: 45-60 seconds
   - Normal: 30-45 seconds
   - Hard: 20-30 seconds

3. Learning Curve: New players might need more time initially, so consider a gradual decrease in allowed time as the game progresses.

4. Complexity: As rules and potato types become more complex, you might need to allow slightly more time.

5. Player Skill Growth: Expert players will process potatoes faster, so the Endless mode could have a gradually decreasing time limit to challenge them.

6. Mini-game Balance: If you're implementing the frying mini-game, ensure the main game's pace allows for occasional diversion without feeling punitive.

As a starting point, I'd suggest aiming for an average of 30-40 seconds per potato on Normal difficulty. This gives players time to:

1. Read the passport (5-10 seconds)
2. Check against rules (10-15 seconds)
3. Make a decision and stamp (5-10 seconds)
4. Process the result and prepare for the next potato (5-10 seconds)

You can implement a timer system to track this:

```gdscript
var processing_time = 40  # seconds
var current_timer = 0

func _process(delta):
    if is_potato_in_office:
        current_timer += delta
        if current_timer >= processing_time:
            # Time's up, force a decision or penalize the player
            force_decision()

func force_decision():
    # Implement logic for when time runs out
    pass

func reset_timer():
    current_timer = 0

# Call reset_timer() when a new potato enters the office
```

Remember to playtest extensively and adjust based on player feedback. The goal is to find a sweet spot where players feel challenged but not overwhelmed, and where the game maintains a satisfying rhythm.
