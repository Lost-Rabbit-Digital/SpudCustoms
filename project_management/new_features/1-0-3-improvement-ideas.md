1.0.3+ improvement ideas:
Based on Alan's detailed feedback report, here are the key actionable items that should be addressed in Spud Customs:

5. Difficulty Balance
- Consider adding more layers of gameplay complexity:
  - Multiple task juggling
    - Preparing a landmine and putting it on the world screen? Click a little preparation button on lower left like stamp to open a minigame for making landmines. 
    - Hacking minigame - Delta Force or Warframe to stop a bunch of runner potatoes spawning all at once
    - Barriers on the road? Pouring concrete or starch?
  - Missile preparation mechanics
  - Time management elements (option for timed mode?)
- Scale runner frequency strongly and missile recharge weakly based on difficulty

Net New Features:

1. Progressive Complexity System
- Start simple but add layers of mechanics over time:
  - Multiple document types to check (visas, work permits, health certificates)
  - Special stamps that require preparation (inking, heating, cooling)
  - Document features to verify (watermarks, UV stamps, fingerprints)

2. Resource Management Elements
- Add meaningful choices around:
  - Crafting from collected contraband for collectibles or power-ups
  - Special power-ups earned through perfect plays, more nuanced than a strike?

4. Parallel Task Management (like Overcooked)
- Add missile preparation steps:
  - Loading ammunition
  - Charging targeting systems  
  - Maintaining cooling systems
- Document processing stations
  - UV light inspection area
  - Fingerprint scanning station
  - Photo verification booth
- Runner monitoring systems (Reduce the chance of runners and show the player % risk)
  - Security camera management (scans left to right, if breaks points down and smokes until clicked)
  - Alarm system maintenance (slows down runners if active, if breaks down, goes off when no runners until clicked)
  - Wall repair, concrete repair mini-game (slows down runners from crossing wall)
  - Guard coordination (shoots stick of butter to help you)

5. Progression System
- Unlockable tools and abilities (Maybe?)
- Office upgrades that affect gameplay (Very cool, alerting players)
- New document types and verification methods
- Different border post locations with unique challenges (Love this, excellent for story mode)

1. Environmental Animation Improvements
```gdscript
# Grass Animation System
class_name GrassAnimator extends Node2D
# Create a shader-based grass animation system that waves procedurally
# Use noise texture to create natural movement patterns
# Add wind gusts that affect grass intensity

# Queue Animation System
class_name QueueIdleAnimator extends Node2D  
# Subtle potato idle animations:
# - Gentle bobbing up/down
# - Occasional side-to-side shuffles
# - Random small rotations
# - Blink/expression changes
```

3. UI Polish
```gdscript
# Create fancier summary screen with:
# - Animated score counters
# - Particle effects for achievements
# - Trophy animations for high scores
# - Dynamic potato crowd reactions

# Enhanced leaderboard with:
# - Winner podium for top 3, full screen with random gen potatoes and their names
# - Player avatars/badges
# - Animated rank changes
# - Special effects for top ranks
```
Here are several ways to add more visual juice and engagement using Godot's capabilities:

1. Document/UI Interactions
```gdscript
# When stamping or moving documents:
- Add slight paper shuffling sounds
- Create subtle paper movement/rotation tweens
- Add drop shadows that adjust dynamically (central top light source?)
- Show subtle particle effects (dust/paper bits)
- Add slight "bounce" when dropping documents
```

2. Ambient Scene Effects
```gdscript
# Background environmental effects:
- Add swaying grass using shader animations
- Create subtle wind particle effects
- Add dynamic lighting/shadows from windows
- Create steam/smoke from the building chimney
- Add birds/insects flying in background
```

3. Score/Points Feedback
```gdscript
# When points are awarded:
- Animate score numbers popping/scaling
- Add floating score text that drifts upward
- Create celebratory particle bursts
- Play satisfying sound effects
- Flash UI elements briefly
```

4. Character Animations
```gdscript
# For potato characters:
- Add idle animations (subtle bouncing)
- Include blinking/expression changes
- Show "thinking" animations while waiting
- Create emotional reactions to decisions
- Add small rotations during movement
```

5. Explosion/Impact Effects
```gdscript
# Enhance existing explosion:
- Add screen shake on impact
- Create multiple layers of particles
- Include smoke trails
- Add flash/lighting effects
- Create debris that bounces/rolls
```

6. Interface Polish
```gdscript
# General UI improvements:
- Add hover states to all interactive elements
- Include subtle button animations
- Create smooth transitions between states
- Add pulsing highlights to important elements
- Include tutorial highlights/callouts
```
