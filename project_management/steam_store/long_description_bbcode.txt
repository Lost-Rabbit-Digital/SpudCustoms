[h1]SPUD CUSTOMS 1.2.0[/h1]
[h2]Stamp Visas. Launch Missiles. Shape History.[/h2]

In the nation of Spud, you're the last line between fragile peace and total chaos. Each shift tests your judgment: inspect documents, expose lies, make impossible choices, and defend your checkpoint with missile systems when potatoes make a run for the border.

[h2]A Story of Choices and Consequences[/h2]

Across 10 story shifts and 22 decision points, you'll shape the destiny of innocent (and not-so-innocent) potatoes. Your choices ripple through the narrative, leading to [b]8 distinct endings[/b]. Become a loyal servant of the regime. Join the resistance. Find love in unexpected places. Or play both sides and watch it all burn.

Will you enforce cruel laws... or risk everything to save innocent spuds?

[h2]The Gameplay[/h2]

Your desk is your battlefield. Passports pile up. The queue grows restless. Check documents against the ever-changing laws, stamp your judgment, and pray you made the right call. When a potato makes a break for it, you've got missiles. Just make sure you're shooting at the guilty ones.

Between shifts, [b]5 minigames[/b] break up the paperwork: scan documents with UV light, sort stamps at lightning speed, match fingerprints, crack codes Wordle-style, and chase contraband down conveyor belts.

[h2]NEW in 1.2.0: Evidence Destruction[/h2]

Security inspection is coming. You have 3 minutes to clear your desk. Every item tells a story: resistance pamphlets, coded messages, Sasha's letters, your loyalty certificate. What do you shred? What do you stash? Wrong choices raise suspicion. Get caught with the wrong evidence and face interrogation.

[h2]The Characters[/h2]

[b]Supervisor Russet[/b] demands loyalty above all else. [b]Sweet Potato Sasha[/b] offers a different path, if you're brave enough to take it. [b]Murphy[/b] carries guilt about his cousin Tommy that threatens to break him. [b]Viktor[/b] just wants to know what happened to his wife. And somewhere in the queue, an elderly traveler named [b]Jen Piper[/b] waits to reunite with the love of her life.

Their fates are in your hands. Every stamp matters.

[h2]Game Feel[/h2]

We sweated the details. The tension system tints your screen red as strikes pile up. Pulsing effects warn you when you're one mistake from disaster. Land a perfect stamp? Screen flash. Slowmo. Particle burst. Your officer mutters commentary as the shift unfolds.

Seven custom music tracks shift with the story's mood. The tutorial holds your hand with glowing highlights, then lets you loose on the chaos.
