Hi folks,

My name is David and I make games at Lost Rabbit Digital. We just took 2nd place in a game jam with our dystopian document parody, "Spud Customs", and we're looking to polish that game and release it on Steam on December 6th.

We are looking for pixel art reminiscent of Papers Please but with a more darkly humorous take rooted in Soylent Green's cannibalistic twist.

You can view and try the game in it's current iteration here. [https://lost-rabbit-digital.itch.io/spud-customs](https://lost-rabbit-digital.itch.io/spud-customs)

We made all the art ourselves and are looking for art at least a little better than ours with better consistency across the various game elements.

**Project Scoping:**

You can see some of the elements we'd need replaced in the game above, but I'm including a rough outline below to aid in scoping discussions.

Menu Backgrounds (1920x1080px, 3x elements)

* Main menu background showcasing the dystopian potato world
* Options menu background
* Credits screen background

Character Designs (64x64px, 14x elements)

* Various potato characters with different expressions and poses
* Customs officer character (player character)
* Background characters for queue scenes

Scene Backgrounds (varies, up to 1280x720px, 3x elements)

* Customs office interior
* Exterior views of the border checkpoint
* Queue area for incoming potatoes

UI Elements (64x64px and smaller, 14x elements)

* Buttons (start, options, exit, etc.)
* Icons for game mechanics (stamps, document types, etc.)
* Progress bars, score displays

Interactive Elements (64x64px, 6 elements)

* Stamps (approval and rejection)
* Documents (passports, ID cards, etc.)
* Desk items (family photo, lamp, etc.)

Short cutscenes (<5 seconds duration, 1280x720, 8 elements)

* Establishing shots (Arriving to customs office)
* Closing shots (Topdown shot of prone customs officer reaching bloody hand up, transition to field of planted potatoes ala last shot of Soylent Green)

**Budget:**

We have $400 budgeted for immediate artwork and can spend about the same on a monthly basis to update artwork and meet this scope.

**Deadline:**

We're aiming for a December 6th release so we'd prioritize the most important artwork first with some updates post-release if things like the cutscenes are larger scope.

**Payment Methods:**

Paypal, Remitly, TransferWise (Wise), Credit Card

**Deliverables format:**

* All artwork delivered in PNG format
* Source files (e.g., Aseprite, PyxelEdit, paint.net) for potential future edits
* A style guide for maintaining consistency in future art creation

**Please submit your application via DM with:**

1. Your portfolio showcasing relevant pixel art work
2. A brief note explaining your interest in the project
3. Your availability and preferred working hours with your time zone
4. Your rate (hourly or per-project)

I look forward to bringing the world of Spud Customs to life with your artistic talent!

-David
