Use PascalCase for node names:
Example: CustomsOffice, PlayerCharacter, EnemySpawner

Be descriptive but concise:
Good: HealthBar, JumpButton, PauseMenu
Avoid: Button1, Sprite2D3, Node2D5

For child nodes that are part of a larger component, you can use more specific names:
Example: Player/Sprite, UI/MainMenu/PlayButton

For organizational nodes (those used purely for structuring), you can use simple, descriptive names:
Example: UI, Enemies, Projectiles

If you're using typed nodes, you don't need to include the type in the name:
Use Player instead of PlayerCharacter
Use PauseMenu instead of PauseMenuControl

For nodes that represent instances of a scene, use the scene name:
If you have a "Coin.tscn", name its instances Coin, Coin2, etc.

For singleton-like nodes or unique game elements, use singular nouns:
Example: GameManager, AudioController, LevelGenerator

For collections or groups, use plural nouns:
Example: Enemies, Powerups, Checkpoints

Applying these conventions to our current scene, you might rename some nodes like this:
CustomsOffice instead of Sprite2D (CustomsOffice)
Megaphone instead of Sprite2D (Megaphone)
SuspectPanel instead of Sprite2D (Suspect Panel)
ApprovalStamp instead of Sprite2D (Approval Stamp)
